# NHL Anlysis


Down the road would like to do some modelling to predict overall team success or individual match-ups for betting purposes.

Before any of that I'm just getting familirart with the different evailable API endpoints. Each of the notebooks simply goes through the process of calling available data and commenting out the possible modifiers.



I'd like to to look at some basic player trends over the years, like afer average age, height, weight, birthplace, etc. and the relationship those have to goals scored, team success, etc.

So far I've created a single DF withevery player in the history of the league with some basic attributes:
- ID
- place of origin
- birthday
- height
- weight
- handedness
- position

Questions to answer:
- How has average height, weight, age, nationality changed among NHL players over the years? What are the trends for prospects specifically?
